# Learn C The Hard Way

I've been doing some of the examples from [Learn C The Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/)

I've started right in the middle, as I've had a tiny bit of C experience. I've pretty much copied out all of the code by hand to get used to typo/compiler errors.

This is also a great educational resource for approaching data types, (I've had no CS experience), so implementing data types helps strengthen my knowledge about the innerworkings.

Around the end of the book, I'll come up with some sort of a "final exam" and create a nice project around it.

In the future, I hope to transition from C and check out Rust.
