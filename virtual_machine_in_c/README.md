# Mini Virtual Machine

Initial base code is from http://blog.felixangell.com/virtual-machine-in-c/

With some extra instructions programmed like:

```
SUB - Subtract
MUL - Multiply
SET - Set Register to Value
GET - Get from Register to Stack
```

I plan to add some branching instructions later on.
